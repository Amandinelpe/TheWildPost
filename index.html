                    <p>This Friday, September 28, Bordeaux Wild Code School played a "holy joke" to the 60 new students coming to learn tech jobs. As part of the 2022 Back-to-School Challenge and based on a certain amount of personal data, the Wild Code School revealed their learning profile and predicted their start of career, deliberately marked "success" or "failure". The pot of roses was only revealed at the end of the day. The goal: to make students aware that their personal data can be used for good or bad purposes.</p>
